## Get API Key

1. **Create an eBird account** (if you don’t already have one):  
   - Go to [https://ebird.org](https://ebird.org) and sign up.

2. **Request an API key**:  
   - Go to [eBird API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59#e18ea3b5-e80c-479f-87db-220ce8d9f3b6).

   - You will receive a string like `abcd1234efgh5678` — this is your API key.

4. **Create a `.env` file** under the root directory with the format:  
   ```bash
   EBIRD_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```
